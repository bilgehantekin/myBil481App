This Java utility method `stringManipulation()` is designed to perform string manipulation tasks based on input arrays of integers, a multiplier and a character.

Parameters:
- firstArray: ArrayList of integers representing the first array of characters.
- secondArray: ArrayList of integers representing the second array of characters.
- multiplier: An integer representing the number of times the concatenated string is to be repeated.
- lastChar: A character representing the character to be appended to the end of the string.

Behavior:
Converts each integer in firstArray and secondArray to its corresponding ASCII character using a cast to char.
Concatenates these ASCII characters into a concatenatedString.
Repeats concatenatedString multiplier times and appends lastChar to the end.
Returns the resulting string.
